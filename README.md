# Docker Compose Configuration

Configuration of multiple docker-compose.yml service file examples.

## How to install docker compose

- Download the docker-compose file

```sh
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.16.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Add executable permission to the file.

```sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Test installation results.

```sh
docker-compose --version
```

## [Dockerfile instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

Before understanding Docker compose, you need to understand Dockerfile.

### FROM
Specify the base image, usually the first instruction of the file, but in fact, you can also use ARG as the first instruction.

```
  # Format
   FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image> [AS <name>]  
   FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[:<tag>] [AS <name>] 
   FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]

  # Usage
   FROM centos
   FROM openjdk:8-jre
   FROM node:12.18.4-alpine@sha256:757574c5a2...
```
**Parameter Description:**
   - `[--platform=<platform>]` is an optional parameter, which can be used to specify the platform of the image, such as Linux/amd64, Linux/arm64, or windows/amd64, usually the default.
   - `<image>` is the image name, followed by `:tag` is the version number used to specify the image, and `@digest` is the content-addressable identifier (you can go to the official website for details). Generally, we only use tags. If two If neither is specified, the latest version is obtained
   - `[AS <name>]` is the name of the current build stage, because multiple FROMs can be used in the Dockerfile to create multiple images, so using as `<name>` can be used in the following COPY command, use `--from=<name>` to refer to the image built earlier, such as copying the files generated by the previous image, etc.

### ARG
This command is used to specify a variable that is passed to the build runtime. It can set a default value. When building a container with the `docker build` command, use `--build-arg <varname>=<value>` to pass parameters.

```
# Format
ARG <name>[=<default value>]

# Usage
ARG CODE_VERSION=laster
ARG testArg=123

# Parameter
FROM centos:7
ARG parameter=123
RUN echo $parameter

docker build --build-arg parameter=234 -t test:1.0

# Note
# ARG can be used before FROM, outside of the FROM build phase, so it cannot be used in any instructions after FROM.
ARG CENTOS_VERSION=laster
FROM centos:${CENTOS_VERSION}
```

### ENV
This command is used to set environment variables for the container, both during the build process and in the launched container.

```
# Format
ENV <key>=<value> ...

# Note
# More than one can be set, or another syntax ENV <key> <value> can be used. The official website recommends using the former, and the latter may be deleted in future versions.
# ENV variables override ARG variables

# Usage
ENV APP_VERSION=1.1.0
ENV WEB_HOME /opt/webapps
```

### COPY
This command is used to copy files or directories from the path to the container.

```
# Format
COPY <src>... <dest>
COPY "<src>",... "<dest>"

# Usage
COPY test.jar /opt/web/
```

### ADD
This command is used to copy files, directories, or remote files to the image, and the tar-type compressed package file will be automatically decompressed.

```
# Format
ADD <src>... <dest>
ADD "<src>",... "<dest>"

# Usage
ADD test.txt /tmp/test
```

### WORKDIR
This command sets the working directory for subsequent directives, if it does not exist, the directory will be created automatically.

```
# Format
WORKDIR /path/to/workdir

# Usage
WORKDIR /build
```

### LABEL 
This command is used to specify the metadata tag information of the image.

```
# Format
LABEL <key>=<value> <key>=<value> <key>=<value> ...

# Usage
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="This text illustrates"
```

### CMD
This command is used to set the command to be executed when the container starts after building the image.

```
# Format
CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]
CMD ["param1","param2"]
CMD command param1 param2

# Usage
CMD sleep 40; node server.js
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### RUN
This command is used to specify the command to be executed when building the image. The main difference between RUN and CMD is that CMD is executed when the container starts, while RUN is executed during the container construction.

```
# Format
RUN <command>
RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

# Usage
RUN yum install -y net-tools
RUN ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo helloworld"]
```

### EXPOSE
This command is used to specify that the container is running on the specified port. You can specify the listening protocol. If not specified, the default is TCP.

```
# Format
EXPOSE <port> [<port>/<protocol>...]

# Usage
EXPOSE 80/udp
EXPOSE 80 443
```

### VOLUME
This command is used to create a mount point with the specified name that can map the directory outside the container.

```
# Format
VOLUME ["/data"]

# Usage
VOLUME /myvol
```

## [Docker compose common commands](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/)

- ps: List all containers of the current project.
- up: Build the container and start the container, common parameters: -d background start, - specify the configuration file.
